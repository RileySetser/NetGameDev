# Project Description

Class Repo for Network Game Dev (001) Spring 2024

Game Title: Simon's Game

A derivative of the classic game "Simon Says"

## Final Remarks

The final build starts immediately in the game scene since I couldn't get scene transitions working in time. 
A known bug is when the time between actions decreases, the host and client's timers get desync by a second. I'm unsure of how to fix this.
Additionally, for some reason, only the colored zones prompt appears despite the code to determine the prompt being a random number, so platforms don't show up at all.

In all honesty, developing a network multiplayer game has been an interesting, yet challenging journey. My biggest resource for this course was Code Monkey's YouTube tutorials about creating a multiplayer game. I'll probably not create another network-based multiplayer game anytime soon, but this course was fun.
